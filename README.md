#  Real Estate Price Prediction

## Instructions

1. **Download the Dataset**  
   - Use the [Real Estate Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quantbruce/real-estate-price-prediction) dataset from Kaggle.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load the dataset and perform any necessary preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, scaling features, etc.).

3. **Model 1: Polynomial Regression**  
   - Train a Polynomial Regression model on the dataset.
   - Experiment with different polynomial degrees and find the degree that gives the best performance.

4. **Model 2: Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
   - Train a Support Vector Regression model using the same dataset.
   - Use an appropriate kernel (e.g., RBF or polynomial) and tune the hyperparameters.

5. **Comparison**  
   - Evaluate both models using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, RÂ²).
   - Compare the performance of Polynomial Regression and SVR.

6. **Report**  
   - Present your results, including:
     - The best hyperparameters and polynomial degree.
     - Metrics for both models.
     - A brief discussion on which model performed better and why.

7. **Submission**  
   - Submit your code, the trained models, and a short report summarizing your findings.
